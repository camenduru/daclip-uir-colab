## ⚠ Important
From https://github.com/Algolzw/daclip-uir#notice <br />

#### Notice!!
In testing we found that the current pretrained model is still difficult to process some real-world images 🙁 which might have distribution shifts with our training dataset (captured from different devices or with different resolutions or degradations). We regard it as a future work and will try to make our model more practical!

We also encourage users who are interested in our work to train their own models with larger dataset and more degradation types.
